# Game-Development-Portfolio
# Hi, 
I am a dedicated and passionate individual who believes in the power of hard work and continuous learning. With each passing day, I strive to expand my knowledge and skills, embracing new opportunities to grow both personally and professionally. Joining your esteemed company would provide me with an ideal platform to further enhance my capabilities while contributing to the company's productivity and success. 
Following are the Projects that I have worked on recently:

# 1. Exodus Black Sun
Exodus: Black Sun is a satirical sci-fi real-time strategy (RTS) game that both pays homage to the golden era of strategy classics and pushes the genre forward with fresh ideas and bold humor. It combines sharp tactical gameplay with a tongue-in-cheek narrative, offering players both the nostalgic thrill of old-school RTS battles and innovative systems that redefine how strategies are executed.

At its core, Exodus: Black Sun is about waging a relentless resource war across hostile alien worlds. Players command armies in large-scale, fast-paced battles where every decision — from resource management to tactical positioning — has meaningful consequences. Unlike traditional RTS games, Exodus: Black Sun introduces new mechanics that give players unprecedented control over how their armies fight, adapt, and evolve throughout a match.

Key features include:

A Satirical Sci-Fi Setting – A darkly comedic take on interstellar war, filled with eccentric factions, sharp writing, and a satirical spin on classic RTS tropes.
Innovative Tactical Systems – Fresh mechanics that let players dictate not just what units they build, but how those units behave on the battlefield, supporting diverse play-styles.
Dynamic Game Modes – From traditional skirmishes to narrative-driven campaigns and experimental multiplayer variants, there’s a mode for every type of strategist.
Resource Warfare Reimagined – Gather, manage, and weaponize resources in ways that add layers of strategy and unpredictability to every encounter.
Reviving the Magic of RTS – Classic elements like base-building, unit micromanagement, and large-scale battles return, enhanced by modern systems and quality-of-life improvements.
With its mix of strategic depth, satirical storytelling, and genre innovation, Exodus: Black Sun offers both long-time RTS fans and new players a chance to experience the excitement of commanding massive armies while laughing at the absurdity of galactic war.

# 5. Melody Of The Forgotten
“Melody of the Forgotten” is a, first-person post-apocalyptic exploration game set in a decaying forest. Players are guided by a mystical bird companion on a quest to find the missing pieces of an ancient bamboo flute. The forest, once full of life, is now withered and silent, its magic lost to time. As players collect flute pieces scattered across different biomes like a swamp, ancient ruins, and a watchtower, they slowly piece together the melody that can restore the land. The bird offers guidance, lore, and subtle emotional cues, functioning both as a narrator and a companion. Once all flute pieces are collected, a cinematic plays that shows the rebirth of the forest as the music returns life to the world."
